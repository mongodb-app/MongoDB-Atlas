2. Follow the installation guide for your operating system.
3. Establish a connection to your Atlas cluster using:
   ```sh
   mongosh "mongodb+srv://<your-cluster>.mongodb.net/test" --username <your-username>
   ```

## System Requirements

MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based solution that operates on major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). System requirements vary depending on the client tools in use:

- **MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`)**:
  - Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Requires a Node.js runtime environment
  - Recommended for 64-bit architectures

- **MongoDB Compass**:
  - Supports Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, and Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian)
  - A minimum of 4GB RAM is recommended for optimal performance

For production environments, ensure that your cloud instance meets the necessary performance criteria (CPU, RAM, storage) to support your application.
